## Introduction

A honeypot is a decoy system used to attract hackers. Why would you use one? Here are some key reasons:

1. **Early Detection**: Honeypots help you identify breaches or intrusions before they can cause significant damage.
2. **Attack Analysis**: They allow you to observe and analyze attacker behavior, tools, and techniques.
3. **Incident Response Testing**: Honeypots provide a controlled environment to test and refine your incident response procedures.

## Types of Honeypots

| **Type**                | **Description**                                                                                       |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Production Honeypots**| Deployed within an organization's production environment. Mimic real systems to lure attackers away from critical assets. Focused on early detection rather than detailed attack analysis. |
| **Research Honeypots**  | Used by security researchers to study attack techniques and trends. Often more complex and designed to capture detailed information about attacks. Operate outside of production environments, with no legitimate users. |
| **Low-Interaction**     | Simulate basic system functionality. Easy to set up and maintain but provide limited information about attackers. Examples include emulated services like SSH or HTTP servers. |
| **High-Interaction**    | Fully functional systems that replicate real services and operating systems. Provide in-depth insights into attacker behavior. Require more resources to set up and monitor. |
| **Malware Honeypots**   | Specifically designed to attract and capture malicious software. Help analyze malware behavior and propagation methods. |
| **Spam Honeypots**      | Target spammers by emulating email servers or open relays. Collect data about spam campaigns and distribution methods. |
| **Database Honeypots**  | Simulate database systems to attract attackers seeking sensitive information. Capture SQL injection attempts and other database-specific attacks. |
